Control your ship and destroy enemies.
You can catch the enemy's broken piece.
Pieces are stuck to your ship and counterattack to enemies.
You can earn the bonus score by keeping many pieces stuck.
Stuck pieces are destroyed when they touch a enemy's bullet.

While holding a slow key, the ship becomes slow and 
the ship direction is fixed.
Stuck pieces are pulled in and you can prevent a crash of them, 
but the bonus score reduces to one fifth.
Enemy's pieces are not stuck while holding this key.

If you stick many pieces, enemies become more offensive and
tend to fire more bullets.

The ship is destroyed when it is hit by a bullet.

The ship extends at 200,000 and every 500,000 points.
